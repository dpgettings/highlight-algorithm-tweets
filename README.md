# Algorithmic Tweet Highlighter

A (tiny) Chrome extension to fix an annoying problem with Twitter's new algorithmic timeline.

## Outline

Twitter recently started showing a selection of algorithmically sorted tweets at the top of users' timelines. The implementation of this feature on Twitter's web interface has an unfortunate design flaw â€” it's difficult to tell where the non-chronological, algorithmic tweets end and the usual chronologically sorted tweets begin.

This project provides a simple Chrome extension that resolves this ambiguity by highlighting the non-chronological, algorithmic tweets on twitter.com.

## Specifics

Algorithmically sorted tweets are marked by Twitter with certain `<div>` tag attributes. This extension injects a (very) small amount of CSS onto Twitter's main timeline that identifies and subtley highlights these tweets.

## Installing

For now, follow the instructions on Chrome's developer site for [loading an unpacked extension](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/getstarted#unpacked).
